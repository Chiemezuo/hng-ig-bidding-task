## Prerequities

1. A computer
2. The repository link.
3. Visual studio code.
4. An internet connection on first installation.
5. The newest version of Node JS installed on your machine. You can google "node install" and follow the links to do that.
6. Command prompt or git bash CLI on your computer.

## Steps
1. First, download a zip file of the repository.
2. Unzip this file, and open with Visual studio code
3. When you open the project folder, press "ctrl" + "shift" + " ` " to open the terminal (Or you could open it without the terminal)
4. Run "npm install" from the terminal in Visual studio code to install all the dependencies of the project.
5. Having ran this command, you can now copy any csv file for your team and paste in the root directory of this project folder. DO NOT PUT IT IN A SEPARATE FOLDER.
6. After this, you type out "npm start ". DO NOT CLICK ENTER YET.
7. Right after you type out "start", give a space, and then type out the first three letters of the csv file and then press the "tab" button on your machine. This will autocomplete.
8. But if that doesn't work, then type out the full file name, with the extenstion, all in quotes.
9. The terminal should look something like 'npm start "dummy file.csv". Then you hit enter.
10. Voila, enjoy the magic.

## If it doesn't work
1. Double-check every step.
2. Try removing the extension name.
3. Then you are doing something wrong, so try to play by the rules.
